<p><strong>M.E.F. Logging PostSharp Tool<span style="text-decoration:underline"><br>
</span></strong></p>
<p>In 2011 I had an interview with Microsoft's &quot;Flight&quot; team.&nbsp; During this interview, I was questioned regarding their M.E.F. framework, which at the time, I knew nothing about.&nbsp; After the interview, I decided to create a new logging tool, which uses
 this very cool M.E.F. framework, coupled with PostSharp.&nbsp; The end-result is a simple but powerful attribute, which allows you to simply drop the attribute onto any of your projects at the namespace level, immediately injecting your project with logging
 capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have updated my M.E.F. logging attribute to now support Microsoft's Enterprise logging framework too! :)</p>
